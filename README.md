# My-first-app
This is my first tryout of Android studio. Never made an app before. I desided what I wanted to learn and teached myself using google and tutorialpoint. 
My learning goals were:
    - Finding out how to make a new activity
    - Making a backbutton in actionbar
    - insert images
    - Linking to other apps
    - Insert, read and delete from a database (no luck)
